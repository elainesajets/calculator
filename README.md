# Calculator

My submission for the Calculator project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

The calculator has a fully interactive UI and supports both **mouse and keyboard input**.

## Possible future fixes

- Make +/- button functional
- 🔁 Improve floating point precision
- 🔲 Handle very large numbers more gracefully
- 🎨 Add dark mode
